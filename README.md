# C++ Concepts Repository

This repository is a collection of examples and demonstrations for various core C++ concepts. It aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the language's features and object-oriented programming principles.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each demonstrating a specific concept. The folder names and the corresponding concepts are as follows:

*   **`01_ClassDemo/DateWithClass`**: Demonstrates a class with a date member.
*   **`02_NamespaceDemo`**: Examples of using namespaces in C++.
*   **`03_ConstructureDemo`**: Demonstrations of class constructors.
*   **`04_ConstructureTypes`**: Examples of different types of constructors.
*   **`05_AssignmentCompulsionExample`**: Example of assignment compulsion
*   **`06_DestructureDemo`**: Examples of class destructors.
*   **`07_ConstKeywordDemo`**: Demonstrations of the `const` keyword.
*  **`08_FriendClass`**: Demonstrations of Friend class.
*   **`09_ReferenceVariable`**: Examples of reference variables.
*   **`10_SingletonClass`**: Implementation of the singleton pattern.
*   **`11_VectorInternalImplementation`**: Examples of vector internal implementation.
*   **`12_DynamicMemoryManagement`**: Examples of dynamic memory management.
*   **`13_StringInternalImplementation`**: Examples of string internal implementation.
*   **`14_STDVectorDemo`**: Examples of using `std::vector`.
*   **`15_OperatorOverloading`**: Demonstrations of operator overloading.
*  **`16_CopyConstructureInternalImplementation`**: Examples of copy constructors internal implementation
*   **`17_IteratorInternalImplementation`**: Demonstrations of the iterator pattern.
*   **`18_NestedClass`**: Examples of nested classes.
*   **`19_VirtualFunction`**: Demonstrations of virtual functions and polymorphism.
*   **`20_InheritanceDemo`**: Examples of inheritance.
*   **`21_InterfaceClassDemo`**: Examples of interface classes.
*   **`22_VPTR_VTABLE`**: Demonstrations of vptr and vtable.
*    **`23_TemplateProgramming`**: Examples of template programming.
*   **`24_PrivatePublicProtectedInheritance`**: Examples of inheritance with private, public, and protected keywords.
*   **`25_SharedPTR`**: Demonstrations of `shared_ptr`.

Additionally, the following supporting files are also present at the root directory:
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `git_push.bat`: Windows batch file for git pushing.

## How to Use

1.  **Explore Folders:** Browse the folders corresponding to the C++ concept you want to explore.
2.  **Review Code:** Each folder will contain C++ source code files (.cpp or .h) along with any relevant explanations and comments inside the code.
3.  **Compile & Run:** Compile and run the code using a C++ compiler (like g++) on your system to see the concepts in action.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or want to add a new concept example, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork:** Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix (e.g., `git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
3.  **Implement:** Make your changes, ensuring the code is well-documented and tested.
4.  **Test:** Include necessary tests.
5.  **Commit:** Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message (e.g., `git commit -m "Add: Demonstration of concept XYZ"`).
6.  **Push:** Push your changes to your branch (e.g., `git push origin my-new-feature`).
7.  **Pull Request:** Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
